== Control Structures

Control structures are a fundamental aspect of any programming language, and
Elixir is no exception. They direct the flow of execution and help us build 
more complex and powerful programs. 

NOTE: You will not use all of these control structures regularly. Have a look
and decide which ones feel useful to you.
