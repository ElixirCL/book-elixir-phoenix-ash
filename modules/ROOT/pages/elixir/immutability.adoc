## Immutability
indexterm:[Elixir,Immutability]

_Immutabilty_ is one of that magic words that you'll hear a lot in the Elixir
community. It's one of the things that makes Elixir so fast and reliable. But
what does it mean?

In simple terms, once you give a value to a variable in Elixir, this value stays
the same. And that means that the given part of memory is not touched until the
function is ended and everything is garbage collected. If you want to change the
value of a variable, the system creates a new memory space with the new value
while the old one still exists. This is called _immutability_.
Counterintiutively it is much faster to just create a new memory space than to
change the value of an existing one. And when data is immutable, it can be
shared freely among multiple processes without the fear of data races or
inconsistencies. This is particularly beneficial in concurrent and distributed
systems, where multiple processes may need to access and operate on the same
data.

NOTE: I thought a lot about this chapter and how to explain immutability and how
complex the explaination should be. At the end of the day I came to the
conculsion that it is not necessary to understand immutability in order to learn
Elixir. Don't stress yourself with this.
