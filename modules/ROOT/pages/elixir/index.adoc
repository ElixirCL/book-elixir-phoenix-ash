= Elixir

Initially I thought I could write a 10 page Elixir introduction with this
chapter. Just to provide the basics to get you going for using the
xref:phoenix/index.adoc[Phoenix] and the xref:phoenix/index.adoc[Ash Framework].
All that by avoiding any chicken-or-egg situations - where an explanation
relies on concepts yet to be discussed.

**I failed!** I ended up with a chapter about Elixir which covers a lot.
It is meant to be read in a linear fashion. But feel free to just skip parts
and come back later (or don't).

If this is your first functional programming language you might want to get a cup
of coffee first. It might take a while to get used to the functional programming
paradigm. **It took me a long time too!**
