=== Interpolation Operator `#{}` in Elixir
indexterm:[Elixir, Operators, Interpolation]

The interpolation operator in Elixir, represented as `#{}`, is a powerful tool used for inserting values within a string. It allows for dynamic expression of values within a string without the need for explicit concatenation.

=== Understanding the Interpolation Operator `#{}`

String interpolation is a process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string. In Elixir, this is achieved using the interpolation operator `#{}`. Here's a simple example:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> name = "Alice"
"Alice"
iex> "Hello, #{name}"
"Hello, Alice"
----

In the example above, the variable `name` is interpolated into the string "Hello, #{name}". The resulting string is "Hello, Alice".

=== Using the Interpolation Operator `#{}`

String interpolation in Elixir can handle more complex expressions, not just variables. This includes arithmetic operations, function calls, and more:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> number = 5
5
iex> "The square of #{number} is #{number * number}"
"The square of 5 is 25"
----

In the above code, the expressions inside the interpolation operator `#{}` are evaluated, and their results are automatically converted into strings and inserted in the appropriate place.

Another powerful aspect of string interpolation in Elixir is that it's not restricted to strings. It can handle any data type that can be meaningfully converted into a string representation, including integers, floats, atoms, lists, and even tuples:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> tuple = {1, 2, 3}
{1, 2, 3}
iex> "The tuple is #{tuple}"
"The tuple is {1, 2, 3}"
----

In the above example, the tuple is automatically converted to its string representation and inserted into the string.

Remember, the expressions inside the interpolation operator `#{}` must be valid Elixir expressions. **The `#{}` operator itself can't be used outside a string, as it's a part of the string syntax, not a standalone operator.**
