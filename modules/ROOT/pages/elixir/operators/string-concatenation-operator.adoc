=== String Concatenation Operator `<>` in Elixir
indexterm:[Elixir, Operators, String Concatenation]

The string concatenation operator in Elixir is the `<>` operator. It plays a fundamental role in handling strings as it enables the combination of two or more strings into a single string.

=== Understanding the `<>` Operator
indexterm:[Elixir, Operators, String Concatenation, Basics]

In Elixir, the `<>` operator takes two strings and merges them together, forming a new string. This process is commonly known as "string concatenation." Here's a simple example:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> "Hello" <> " world"
"Hello world"
----

In the above example, `"Hello"` and `" world"` are two separate strings. The `<>` operator combines them into one string: `"Hello world"`.

=== Using the `<>` Operator
indexterm:[Elixir, Operators, String Concatenation, Usage]

In practice, the `<>` operator is extensively used when there's a need to dynamically construct a string. It allows parts of the string to be variables that can change depending on the program's context:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> greeting = "Hello"
"Hello"
iex> name = "Alice"
"Alice"
iex> greeting <> ", " <> name
"Hello, Alice"
----

In the example above, `greeting` and `name` are variables holding different string values. Using the `<>` operator, we can concatenate these variables with another string (", ") to create the desired output.

It's important to note that the `<>` operator only works with strings. Attempting to concatenate a non-string data type without first converting it to a string will result in an error:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> "The answer is " <> 42
** (ArgumentError) "argument error"
----

To avoid such errors, ensure all operands of the `<>` operator are strings. For example, you can use the `Integer.to_string/1` function to convert an integer to a string:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> "The answer is " <> Integer.to_string(42)
"The answer is 42"
----
