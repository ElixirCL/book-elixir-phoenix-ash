=== Arithmetic Operators
indexterm:[Elixir,Operators,Arithmetic]

Arithmetic operators in Elixir allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations. These operators work with numbers and support integer as well as floating-point arithmetic.

Here are the primary arithmetic operators:

* Addition (+): This operator adds two numbers together.

[source,elixir]
----
iex> 2 + 2
4
----

* Subtraction (-): This operator subtracts the second number from the first.

[source,elixir]
----
iex> 4 - 2
2
----

* Multiplication (*): This operator multiplies two numbers.

[source,elixir]
----
iex> 3 * 3
9
----

* Division (/): This operator divides the first number by the second. Note that it always returns a float.

[source,elixir]
----
iex> 10 / 2
5.0
----

If you need integer division, you can use the `div/2` function:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> div(10, 2)
5
----

* Remainder (%): This operator returns the remainder of an integer division.

[source,elixir]
----
iex> 10 % 3
1
----

Again, Elixir provides a built-in function `rem/2` for getting the remainder:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> rem(10, 3)
1
----

It's important to know that these operators follow standard mathematical precedence rules. If you want to ensure a specific order of operations, use parentheses to make your intentions clear:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> 2 + 2 * 3
8

iex> (2 + 2) * 3
12
----

Elixir's arithmetic operators are not just for integers and floats; they can also operate on other data types, such as complex numbers and matrices, provided the appropriate libraries are installed. However, the focus here is on their use with numbers.
