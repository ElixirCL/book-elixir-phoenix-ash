== Variables
indexterm:["Variables"]

In Elixir, variable names adhere to the 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case[snake_case] format. They start with a 
lowercase letter, and words are separated by underscores (_). 

Take a look at the following examples:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> length = 10 <1>
10
iex> width = 23
23
iex> room_area = length * width
230
----
<1> Here, the `=` operator assigns the value 10 to the variable `length`.

Variable names starting with an uppercase letter will throw an error:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> RoomWidth = 2
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 2 <1>
----
<1> The `MatchError` might seem strange at this point, but fear not! Its 
mystery will unravel as we dive deeper into Elixir's realm and learn about 
pattern matching.
