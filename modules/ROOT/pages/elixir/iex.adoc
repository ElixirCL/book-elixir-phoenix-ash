== Elixir's Interactive Shell (IEx)

Elixir equips you with an interactive shell, `IEx` (Interactive Elixir), that's
going to be our sandbox for a lot of examples in this chapter. So let's roll up
our sleeves and give it a whirl in your command line: indexterm:[IEx,
Interactive Elixir]

[source,elixir]
----
$ iex
Erlang/OTP 26 [erts-14.0] [source] [64-bit] [...]

Interactive Elixir (1.15.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)> <1>
----
<1> This is your IEx prompt.

IMPORTANT: To bid goodbye to IEx, give `CTRL-C` a double tap or a single `CTRL-\` will do.

TIP: IEx provides autocomplete (just tap `TAB` when you're unsure) and a command
history (the arrow-up key is your friend).
