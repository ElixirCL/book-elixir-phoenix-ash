== Enumerables

In Elixir, an enumerable is any data structure that can be traversed or iterated
over. Examples of enumerable data structures include lists like [1, 2, 3], maps
like %{a: 1, b: 2}, and ranges like 1..3. All these structures can be processed
using the functions provided by the Enum module.

This chapter covers the enumerable module `Enum`, its functions, and the concept 
of lazy enumeration with the `Stream` module.
