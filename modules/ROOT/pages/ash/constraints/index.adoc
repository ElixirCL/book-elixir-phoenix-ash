## Constraints

Contraints can be used to validate input data. This can be a
bit misleading for newbies because in addition xref:ash-validations[validations] are
a thing too. Contraints work for attributes and arguments.

NOTE: Different datatypes have different constraints.
You can use `:allow_empty?` for `string` but not for `integer`.

Need more information about contraints? Have a look at the official Ash
documentation at
