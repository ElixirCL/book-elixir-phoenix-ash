## Minimal Ash 2.x Setup Guide

There are a couple of steps we need to do for every new mix project 
which uses Ash. This guide will walk you through those steps. For this 
book we use the very generic name `app` for the application. Please 
use a more meaningful name for your own applications. We keep using 
`App` in this guide to make it easier to mix and match seperate parts 
of this book if you want to.

WARNING: To use `app` as the default application name in this book has 
one major drawback: You have to either rename old project directories or 
delete them when creating a new one. Alternatively you can change the 
appname with all examples to something like `app2`, 'app2', 'foobar', etc.

Let's start with a fresh Mix project:

```bash
$ mix new --sup app
$ cd app
```

We change the dependency in `mix.exs` to add Ash (find the latest 
Ash version number at https://hex.pm/packages/ash):

**mix.exs**
```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:ash, "~> 2.14.16"} # Add this line
  ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get` to install it:

```bash
$ mix deps.get
```

To make sure that we get the right formatting for our code, we change 
the file `.formatter.exs` to include the Ash formatter:

**.formatter.exs**
```elixir
[
  import_deps: [:ash], # <-- add this line
  inputs: ["{mix,.formatter}.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}"]
]
```

TIP: The Elixir formatter is a great tool to keep your code consistent. 
It is highly recommended to use run the command `mix format` before 
committing your code into a repository. Depending on your editor you can
autoformat your code with it without having to run the command manually.

Since this is a fresh project we need to create a `config.exs` file:

```bash
$ mkdir config
$ touch config/config.exs
```

And add the configuration for Ash to `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
import Config

config :ash, :use_all_identities_in_manage_relationship?, false
```

IMPORTANT: If not configured otherwise Ash uses
link:https://hexdocs.pm/ash/Ash.DataLayer.Ets.html[Ash.DataLayer.Ets] as
a database layer. ETS (Erlang Term Storage) is an in memory data store
which is build into your Erlang system. For our training purpose this 
is ideal because we don't have to install and configure a database (e.g.
PostgreSQL). **But ETS does not save any data to disk!** With every 
restart of these examples you will have to re-create the data.
