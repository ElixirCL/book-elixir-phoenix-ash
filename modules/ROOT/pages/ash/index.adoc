= Ash Framework

The Ash Framework's official site, link:https://ash-hq.org[ash-hq.org],
proclaims, *"Model your domain, derive the rest."* While this statement
resonates once you're familiar with Ash, it might not immediately clarify the
framework's essence for newcomers.

Believe me, investing time in understanding Ash is worthwhile. My background is
rooted in Ruby on Rails, and I transitioned to Phoenix for its speed and
scalability. However, Ash elevates the development process to an other level.

Like the Phoenix Framework the Ash Framework has no shortage of
online documentation. But most of it is not beginner friendly
and very often a mystery in itself. This book and the
link:https://www.youtube.com/@elixir-phoenix-ash[@elixir-phoenix-ash YouTube channel]
is my endeavor to bridge this knowledge gap.

For feedback or inquiries about training (both onsite and remote), please reach out to me at sw@wintermeyer-consulting.de.

TIP: For official support, visit the Ash Framework community on https://elixirforum.com. The community is incredibly welcoming, so don't hesitate to pose any questions you might have. See you there!
