= Ash Framework

The link:https://ash-hq.org[Ash Framework] is a tool to work with
resources which represent your data. It is a set of conventions and
rules about how to do that. By using Ash you'll get a lot of
functionality for free. A popular example for this are the GraphQL
and RESTful JSON APIs. It takes litterly minutes to create them on
a given Ash project.

We do not build one big monolithic application in this book but use
smaller examples to describe features. This has the disadvantage that
I have to repeat some boilerplate code in each example. But it has
the big advantage that you can easily understand each example without
the rest of the book. If a specific feature is of no interest for you
just skip that section.
