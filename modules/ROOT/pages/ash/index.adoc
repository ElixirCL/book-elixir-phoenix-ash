= Ash Framework

The link:https://ash-hq.org[Ash Framework] is currently the most
powerful and productive set of tools in the Phoenix ecosystem for developers.
I wrote this book to have written material for beginner's
training I offer (shameless plug: please write me an email to
sw@wintermeyer-consulting.de if you are
interested in a training). But sharing is caring so I decided to make most
of it available online too.

The Ash Framework does offer a lot of documentation and a vibrant
community which is ready to help on link:https://discord.gg/elixir[Discord].
But Discord is not everyone's cup of tea (some companies don't allow
the usage at all) and the official documentation is often a bit too theoretical.

This beginner's book provides small copy-and-pastable examples. In addition
I publish short tutorial videos - without sound so that you can watch them in
the office too - on the
link:https://www.youtube.com/@elixir-phoenix-ash[@elixir-phoenix-ash YouTube channel].

I do not build one big monolithic application in this book but use
smaller examples to describe features. This has the disadvantage that
I have to repeat some boilerplate code in each example. But it has
the big advantage that you can easily understand each example without
the rest of the book. If a specific feature is of no interest for you
just skip that section.

NOTE: Ash often provides multiple ways to achieve the same goal. I see
little value of displaying all of them in a beginner's book. I just
pick and describe one.
