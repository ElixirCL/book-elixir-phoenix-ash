## Relationships
indexterm:[Ash, Relationships]

Relationships define connections between resources. In any application this
is the bread and butter of the data modeling.

### Setup

We discuss relationships in the context of a simple online shop. Please
use xref:ash/minimal-ash-2x-setup-guide.adoc[Minimal Ash 2.x Setup Guide] to generate
a new Elixir application. After that create or adapt the following files for a
`Product` resource:

[source,elixir,title='config/config.exs']
----
import Config

config :app, :ash_apis, [App.Shop]
----

[source,elixir,title='lib/app/shop.ex']
----
defmodule App.Shop do
  use Ash.Api

  resources do
    resource App.Shop.Product <1>
  end
end
----

<1> We always have to create an internal API and include all resources in it.

[source,elixir,title='lib/app/shop/resources/product.ex']
----
defmodule App.Shop.Product do
  use Ash.Resource, data_layer: Ash.DataLayer.Ets

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id
    attribute :name, :string
    attribute :price, :decimal
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
  end

  code_interface do
    define_for App.Shop
    define :create
    define :read
    define :by_id, get_by: [:id], action: :read
    define :by_name, get_by: [:name], action: :read
    define :update
    define :destroy
  end
end
