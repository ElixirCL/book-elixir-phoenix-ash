## Validations

Within Ash we have two different types of validations:

- Attribute Validations
  Those are used to validate the input data before it is saved to the
  database.
- Action Validations
  Those are used to validate the input data before an action is executed.

You could use action validations to validate attributes but not
vice versa.
