## Validations

In case you are joining us from the Ruby on Rails world (as I did initially),
you will find the whole Ash validation system a bit different - even strange.

There are two areas where validations are used:

- Attributes
  Those are used to validate the input data before it is saved to the
  database.
- Actions
  Those are used to validate the input data before an action is executed.
