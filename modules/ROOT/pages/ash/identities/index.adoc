[[ash-identities]]
## Identities

In many other frameworks uniquness of an attribute is part of the validation.
Ash has a different approach. It uses `identities` and to make matters worse
there is a difference between ETS and PostgreSQL. In PostgreSQL the database
takes care of uniqueness. In ETS you have to do it yourself.

<1> This is the code you'd need to use for PostgreSQL. It is commented out
because we are using ETS in this example.
<2> This is the ETS version. Delete it in case you want to use PostgreSQL.

Let's try to create a product with the same name twice:

```elixir
$ iex -S mix
iex(1)> App.Shop.Product.create!(%{name: "Banana",
                                   price: 0.1,
                                   stock_quantity: 12})
#App.Shop.Product<
  __meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded>,
  id: "321070d5-6cec-4054-a99a-c5036a80e7d0",
  name: "Banana",
  ...
>
iex(2)> App.Shop.Product.create!(%{name: "Banana",
                                   price: 0.2,
                                   stock_quantity: 1})
