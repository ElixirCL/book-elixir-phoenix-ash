# Friendly Book License

Hello there! First off, thank you for taking the time to check out this book,
its source code and this license. Your interest and enthusiasm are genuinely
appreciated.

## Reasoning Behind This License
I'm currently in the process of searching for a publisher for this book. As you might be aware, not all publishers are fans of open-source licenses. To ensure that I have the flexibility and rights needed to work with a wide range of publishers, I've chosen this particular licensing approach. I hope you understand and respect this decision.

### 1. Viewing and Using the Source Code
Feel free to explore, learn from, and enjoy the source code of this book. It's available for everyone to view on GitHub.

### 2. Contributing and Pull Requests
If you've found ways to improve the content or have suggestions, I'd be thrilled to receive pull requests from you. By sending a pull request, you acknowledge and agree that your contributions will become part of the book and its source code. In other words, once you submit a pull request and it's accepted, the content you've added or modified becomes mine. This isn't your typical open-source license, but it ensures that the book remains cohesive and consistent.

### 3. No Redistribution
While you're welcome to view and learn from the source code, please refrain from redistributing the book or its content without explicit permission.

### 4. Acknowledgment
While I retain the rights to all contributions, I value and appreciate your input. I'll do my best to acknowledge contributors in a way that celebrates our collaborative spirit.

Thank you for understanding and for being a part of this journey.

Viele Grüße
